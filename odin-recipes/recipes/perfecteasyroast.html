        <h2>The Roast in Question</h2>
        <img class= "fit" src= "../recipes/recipe_photos/roast.jpeg" alt="The Perfect Roast">
    <p>If you have ever had a dry tough roast, you understand the frustration and desire to find 
        something, any recipe, to satisfy the qualities of a tender, juicy, flavorful
        roast! Why waste your money on a piece of meat or other form of protein just to consume
        an unsatisfactory outcome. Among other proteins, I have found that utilizing a smoker to 
        cook roast has been the absolute, most satisfying version.

    <h3>Yield 2 Servings</h3>
        <h5>It is recommended that you find a good quality meat ingredient for best results, but 
            the use of this method produces a far more satisfactory result, resulting in a 
            lower end meat becoming almost unrecognizeable, and pushing high quality meats to 
            new levels of flavor and texture.
        </h5>
        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
