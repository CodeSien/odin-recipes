        <img class= "fit" src= "../recipes/recipe_photos/roast.jpeg" alt="The Perfect Roast">
    <p>If you have ever had a dry tough roast, you understand the frustration and desire to find 
        something, any recipe, to satisfy the qualities of a tender, juicy, flavorful
        roast! Why waste your money on a piece of meat or other form of protein just to consume
        an unsatisfactory outcome. Among other proteins, I have found that utilizing a smoker to 
        cook roast has been the absolute, most satisfying version.
