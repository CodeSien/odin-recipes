        <h2>A Lovely Example of the Snow</h2>
        <img class= "fit" src= "../recipes/recipe_photos/snow.jpg" alt ="Creamy Shaved Ice">
    <p>The problem with shaved ice is the usual under pulverized texture of the solidified 
            water mixing with a sweet liquid applied on top. The flavorless quality of ice 
            reduces the capacity for layering flavor and creating a strong taste on a medium
            that will be void of sugar juice by the time it melts into water. There is a way
            to create something like ice cream and shaved ice all-in-one.

    <h3>Yield 2 Servings</h3>
      <h5>Method of pulverization is best handles with the use of a food processor. It is possible
        to create the recipe with the use of a cheese grater, but freezing process will vary.
        For skill level extreme, freeze large block when intending to utilize a cheese grater.
        For skill level easy, freeze cubes (about 2 trays) to be grated using food processor.
