        <p>The problem with shaved ice is the usual under pulverized texture of the solidified 
            water mixing with a sweet liquid applied on top. The flavorless quality of ice 
            reduces the capacity for layering flavor and creating a strong taste on a medium
            that will be void of sugar juice by the time it melts into water. There is a way
            to create something like ice cream and shaved ice all-in-one.
