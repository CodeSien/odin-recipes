     <p>At times, we desire an island inspired treat of a meal, but we know if we broke da mouth we break the bank. 
      Did you know that you can make a comparable, delicious alternative with a few tomatoes?
      Feel free to add or ommit any toppings from our recipe to make your experience personally
      appealing. Remember, veggie alternatives don't have to be boring. Furthermore, it is not necessary
      to include formulated protein alternatives to deliver a similarly desired flavor.
      You won't regret giving it a try for yourself!
     </p>
     <h3>Yield 3-4 Servings</h3>
     <h5>Marinade can be prepared ahead of time
      to absorb flavor overnight, but for best results
      marinade for at least 30 minutes.</h5>
   <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    
    <h4><strong>Sauce/Marinade</strong></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>sesame oil [3 tbsp]</li>
      <li>sriracha [2 tbsp]</li>
      <li>dehydrated seaweed, crumbled [3/4 cup]</li>
      <li>coconut aminos or soy sauce [1/2 cup]</li>
      <li>lime juice [3/4 cup]</li>
      <li>rice vinegar [3 tbsp]</li>
    </ul>
   <h4><strong>Suggested Veggies + Toppings</strong></h4>
   <ul>
      <li>tomatoes [1 cup] , can be supplemented 
         with watermelon or tofu for different 
         flavor or texture profile</li>
      <li>avocados [2]</li>
      <li>dehydrated seaweed, crumbled [1/4 cup]</li>
      <li>cucumber [1/2 cup]</li>
      <li>onion crisp [2 tbsp]</li>
      <li>edamame [3/4 cup]</li>
      <li>sesame seeds [2 tsp]</li>
      <li>kewpie mayo [1/2 cup]</li>
      <li>sriracha [2 tbsp]</li>
    </ul>
   <h4><strong>Suggested Base</strong></h4>
    <p>For best experience, use white rice as base. Consider enjoying half white recipe
      with a leafy green or cabbage. You can also incorporate a cold noodle, such as soba,
      as a similarly hearty base or a brown rice for another option. For a lighter choice, 
      less dense in carbohydrates, the recipe is also enjoyable with greens and cabbage alone.
